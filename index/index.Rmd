# Abstract {-}

This thesis investigates the changes in the ownership of multi-family rental complexes in Durham between 2000 and 2018 and their subsequent impact on housing stability. Specifically, I model and compare the likelihood that an eviction filing is issued by corporate and individual landlords in the periods before and after a transaction. Since the early 2000s, institutional investor share in all property sizes has increased dramatically in the United States. In 2013, the Blackstone Group released the first-ever rated bond backed by single-family securitized rental payments, and since then, numerous firms have followed with similar security offerings, which as of 2018 include bonds backed by multi-family rental income. The surge of institutional investment in multi-family rental properties and its impacts on communities have remained largely ignored in academic literature. Durham County currently holds one of the highest eviction rates in North Carolina and ranks in the top 40 of highest evicting large cities in the United States. In my thesis, I uncover how ownership of rental properties in Durham has changed since the early 2000s and investigate whether the behaviors of "corporate landlords" differ significantly from those of individual investors (or “mom and pop” landlords”). I find that the proportion of properties under corporate ownership has increased across all property sizes since 2000, and the proportion of corporate owners that are based out-of-state has also increased. I also find evidence to suggest that different sizes of multi-family properties should be examined distinctly, as I uncover different trends across property sizes in both ownership and eviction rates. Using a fixed effects model, I find that overall, individuals appear to have a higher likelihood of filing an eviction against a tenant compared to institutional landlords in the months before and after a transaction. Finally, I find that large investors amongst both corporates and individuals, defined as investors that own more than 15 properties in Durham, are significantly more likely to evict than smaller investors are.

# Acknowledgements {-}

I would like to begin by thanking my professors, Professor Christopher Timmins, Professor Colin Rundel and Professor Grace Kim. Thank you to Professor Timmins for your support and guidance at all hours of the day, and for constantly challenging me to think critically about the questions I was asking and the methodology I was using. It was a pleasure working with you this year, and I learned so much from you. Thank you to Professor Rundel for your wisdom and patience. I did not realize that pursuing research was not only an academic pursuit but also a huge emotional undertaking, and your insight and calming presence was so critical in this process. Thank you for listening to every idea I had with an open-mind, and walking with me through the detailed processes necessary to get answers to each of these curiosities. Thank you also to Professor Grace Kim for your feedback and your constant support of my winding research path, as well as of my career throughout Duke. 
Thank you to John Killeen at DataWorks. Without your trust in me to pursue this research question with the care it deserves, this research would not have been possible. Thank you for all of the brainstorming sessions and hours spent investigating imperfect data problems. I learned so much through your mentorship. 
Thank you to the Durham Sherriff’s Department and Durham Tax Administration for letting me work with this data in my thesis. Finally, thank you to all of the friends who have kept me sane as I panicked about this research project: Anna-Karin Hess, David Pfeiffer, and Juan Philippe, I could not have done this without your support! 


# Dedication {-}

I would like to dedicate my thesis to my dad, who enjoys doing research as a fun hobby and inspired me to think that I might be the same. Guess this is one of the few ways that we are different, dad!
